      <p>Hey everyone!</p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        I hope you're all doing amazing! This week has been full of little
        miracles, but one of the biggest ones came in the form ofâ€¦ a taco. Yes,
        you read that right. A taco.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        It all started when my companion and I were out knocking doors, and let
        me tell you, it was a rough day. Door after door, rejection after
        rejection. We were hot, tired, and honestly a little discouraged. Then,
        out of nowhere, this super nice lady comes outside and says,
        &quot;Elders! You look like you need a taco.&quot;
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Now, I'm not one to turn down a taco (because that would be a sin,
        right?), so we graciously accepted. As we sat down, we started talking
        with her, and she told us she used to meet with missionaries years ago
        but lost touch. She said she had been thinking about coming back to
        church but wasn't sure where to start. Coincidence? I think not!
      </p>

      <p>
        Long story short, we set up a return appointment, and she even invited
        her family to listen in. All because of a taco. It made me think about
        how the Lord really does work in mysterious waysâ€”even through the humble
        hands of a taco-loving stranger.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-1">
        So moral of the story: Never underestimate the power of a taco.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Or better yet, never underestimate how the Lord places people in our
        path right when we need them most.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-1">
        Hope you all have an amazing week! And if you get the chance, eat a taco
        in honor of this tender mercy. ðŸŒ®âœ¨
      </p>

      <p>Much love,</p>
